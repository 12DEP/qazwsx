Native implementation of Hikvison cameras\NVRs integration which relies on Hikvision ISAPI

This integration connects hikvision devices via __local__ http xml api (ISAPI). While there is a
 [stock hikvision integration ](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/hikvision/) there are 
 some key differences you might concider before making a choice:
 
* Stability. The author of this library wasn't manage to make it work reliably at least with NVR MODEL_NAME_HERE
* Config Flow. This integration uses config flow so you could connect your devices and modify configuration settings without the need to reboot home assistant.
* Healthcheck alerts could trigger home assistant event which makes it easier to handle with automations.
* Status sensors. It could monitor NVR params e.g. CPU\Mem\Disk usage which could be handy for health monitoring.
* Multiple platforms. E.g. apart of watching alert stream this integration could discover and create camera entities.

## Notes for developers and contributor

In order to setup developer's environment it's recommended to do the following:

1. Setup home assistant dev instance localy and make sure you could run and debug it. If you don't have one follow this steps:
    
    1. Create new folder `mkdir hass-dev && cd hass-dev`
    1. Create virtual env `virtualenv venv`
    1. Create configuration file `touch configuration.yaml` and put minimal config there: 
       ```
       TBD MINIMAL CONFIG
       ```
    1. Run home assistant like this `TBD`. You could use your favourite IDE and debuger e.g. for PyCharm the configuration might look like this. 

2. Make sure you have a folder `custrom_components` at the same level you have your `configuration.yaml`. If not - create it `mkdir custrom_components`

3. Checkout this repository into __separate folder__ located **outside** of the `hass-dev` tree. 

4. Create a symlink to bind the main component folder to the `hass-dev/custom_components`
